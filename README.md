# Phase Two Problems
> __NOTE__ These problems came directly from our 'mission requirements', below you will find more explenation

#### a. Using any available code library of your choice (or implement your own), automate the regex to NFA to DFA conversion from Phase 1.
#### b. Modify your regex solution such that, given a positive integer k, allows for regexes with nesting levels at most k deep.
#### c. Using your implementation/chosen library, create a table that compares k vs. the sizes of the regexes produced vs. the size of the NFA vs. the size of the DFA vs. the size of the minimum DFA.
